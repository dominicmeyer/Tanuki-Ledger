This application is right now in an early stage of development.

More descriptions coming soon.

## Development

This code uses multiple tools to ensure a high code-quality.

### Git-Hooks

Git-hooks are used to locally ensure code quality.
If you wanna help development please use them too, to ensure your code meets the basic criterias.
All git-hooks are stored in the `git-hooks` directory. Please make sure they are executable and symlink them into `.git/hooks`.
Please note, that when creating the symlink, you have [adjust the origin path](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4594681/18709964) in order for git to execute the script.

For the `pre-commit` hook you'll need to install `golangci-lint`, `goimports` and `gocyclo`. All are available trough the `go install` command. If you are using the devcontainer they are installed by default.
